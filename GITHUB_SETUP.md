🧵 Thread: Building a Movie Recommendation System

1/5 Just shipped a comprehensive movie rec system using the MovieLens 20M dataset. Here's what I learned about collaborative filtering + ML... 

2/5 The key insight: combining similarity matrices with engineered features gives better results than either approach alone. XGBoost + user_bias + movie_popularity = 🔥

3/5 Performance: RMSE 0.83, MAPE 21.8%. The system handles cold starts and can recommend in real-time for 138K+ users.

4/5 Tech stack: Python, XGBoost, pandas, scikit-learn. Modular design makes it easy to swap algorithms and scale.

5/5 Open source on GitHub: [link]. Includes Jupyter analysis, complete pipeline, and deployment guide.
